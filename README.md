# Print test

Please write a Ruby program that will print the numbers 1 to 100 on separate lines except for 
* if the number is divisible by 3, in which case it should print 'People', 
* if it is divisible by 5, in which case it should print 'Power'  
* if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then it should print 'People Power' 

## Instructions
* Ensure you have ruby 3.0.0 install locally preferably by using a ruby version manager like rbenv
* Run `bundle install` to install the dependencies
* Run the tests with `bundle exec rake` or `bundle exec rspec`. A coverage report will also be generated under `/coverage/index.html`.
* Run the script with `ruby runner.rb`
